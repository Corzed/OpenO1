   ```bash
   python OpenO1.py
   ```

### Example Query:
Prompt:
```markdown
How many 'r's are in the word 'strawberry'?
```

Reasoning:
```markdown
Step 1:
To determine how many 'r's are in the word 'strawberry', the first step is to analyze the spelling of the word itself. 

1. **Identify the letters in 'strawberry'**:  
   The word 'strawberry' consists of the following letters: s, t, r, a, w, b, e, r, r, y.

Next, I will count the occurrences of the letter 'r' in this list.

**DECISION: CONTINUE**: The next step is to count how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word 'strawberry'.

Step 2:
Now, I will count the occurrences of the letter 'r' in the word 'strawberry':

2. **Count the 'r's**:  
   In the spelling: s, t, **r**, a, w, b, **e**, **r**, **r**, y, we can identify the positions of the 'r's:
   - The first 'r' appears after 't' in the third position.
   - The second 'r' appears after 'e' in the seventh position.
   - The third 'r' appears after the second 'r' in the eighth position.

Now, let's tally them up. 

**DECISION: STOP**: The counting process has concluded, and we have identified that there are a total of **three 'r's** in the word 'strawberry'.
```

Output:
```markdown
There are three 'r's in the word 'strawberry'.
```
